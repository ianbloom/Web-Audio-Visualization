# Web-Audio-Visualization

Visualizers utilizing Web Audio API, Javascript, JQuery, D3, CSS, and HTML.

Frequency information is obtained from Web Audio using an Analyser Node.  Scalable Vector Graphics are updated in real time using data 
from the analyser node with a combination of D3.js and JQuery.js.  Try these visualizers with your favorite songs!

Open the visualizers by loading the HTML file, making sure the filepath of the audio element matches your song name in the same folder.  
Furthermore, make sure the .js file of the same name is in your source folder.
